Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) is a feature in Elasticsearch that allows you to automate the process of managing the lifecycle of your indices, including creating, managing, and deleting indices. ILM makes it easy to manage your data over time, while also ensuring that you are not wasting storage resources on data that is no longer needed. 

<!--more-->

The lifecycle of an index typically includes four phases: 

- Hot phase: During this phase, the index is actively being written to and queried. The index is optimized for fast write and query performance. 

- Warm phase: During this phase, the index is no longer being actively written to, but it is still being queried. The index is optimized for query performance rather than write performance. 

- Cold phase: During this phase, the index is no longer being queried or written to. The index is usually stored on slower, cheaper storage than the hot or warm phases. 

- Delete phase: During this phase, the index is no longer needed and can be safely deleted. 

ILM allows you to define policies that automate the process of transitioning an index through these phases based on its age, size, or other criteria. For example, you might define a policy that moves an index from the hot phase to the warm phase after a certain amount of time has elapsed since it was created, and then moves it from the warm phase to the cold phase after a certain amount of additional time has elapsed. Finally, when the index is no longer needed, the policy can be configured to delete the index automatically. 

By using ILM, you can simplify the management of your Elasticsearch indices, reduce storage costs, and ensure that you are retaining data only as long as it is needed. 

### Write index lifecycle management for a sample index with 30 day cycle for one phase to other

```bash
PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "min_age": "0ms",
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_size": "50GB",
            "max_age": "30d"
          }
        }
      },
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "30d",
        "actions": {
          "forcemerge": {
            "max_num_segments": 1
          },
          "shrink": {
            "number_of_shards": 1
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "60d",
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the index will start in the hot phase and remain there until it reaches a maximum size of 50GB or 30 days have elapsed, whichever comes first. At that point, the policy will automatically trigger a rollover action, which creates a new index with the same name and settings as the original index and starts writing to the new index. The old index will then move to the warm phase. 

In the warm phase, the index will remain until it has been in existence for 30 days, at which point the policy will trigger two actions: a forcemerge action to optimize the index for query performance and a shrink action to reduce the number of shards to one (since the index is no longer being written to). Once the index has been in the warm phase for 60 days, it will move to the delete phase and be deleted automatically. 

Of course, you may need to adjust these settings based on the specific needs of your use case, but this example should give you a good starting point for configuring Index Lifecycle Management in Elasticsearch. 

### Apply index lifecycle management policy to an existing index

To apply an Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policy to an existing index in Elasticsearch, you can use the `_ilm` API endpoint to change the index's current lifecycle state and associate it with the new policy. 

Here's an example of how to apply an ILM policy named `my_policy` to an existing index named `my_index` 

```bash
PUT /my_index/_settings
{
  "index.lifecycle.name": "my_policy",
  "index.lifecycle.rollover_alias": "my_index"
}
```
In this example, we're using the `_settings` API endpoint to update the settings of the `my_index` index. We're setting the `index.lifecycle.name` parameter to the name of the ILM policy we want to apply (`my_policy`) and the index.lifecycle.rollover_alias parameter to the name of the index (`my_index`) to indicate that this index is the one that should be managed by the policy. 

After running this command, Elasticsearch will start managing the index according to the rules defined in the `my_policy` policy. For example, if the policy is set up to rollover the index when it reaches a certain size or age, Elasticsearch will automatically create a new index and start writing to it, while the old index will be transitioned to the warm or cold phase as specified by the policy.
